I research how AI agents coordinate at scale and build production tools to make it practical. I also write about the human side of this transformation—from identity crisis to new possibilities.

## 🔬 Research

**[Harmonic Coordination Theory (HCT)](https://github.com/stefanwiest/hct-core)** — A musical ontology for multi-agent coordination

Current frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI) give you tools for orchestration, but lack a shared language for *coordination semantics*—timing, quality, intent, and harmony. HCT fills this gap using musical performance as the ontology: cues, fermatas, tempo, and dissonance become engineering primitives.

## 🛠️ Tools

I build production tools that solve real problems—usually ones I've encountered myself.

### [EnvCheck](https://github.com/envcheck/envcheck)
> **The Validator**

Fast, modern Rust CLI that detects `.env` file issues and syncs with Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions, Helm, and ArgoCD. Better than dotenv-linter with 10x more features.

- 🔧 [K8s sync, Terraform integration, TUI, SARIF output](https://github.com/envcheck/envcheck)
- 📦 `cargo install envcheck` · `npm install -g @envcheck/cli`
- ⚡ [envcheck.github.io](https://envcheck.github.io) — Documentation

### [NerfStatus](https://github.com/nerfstatus/nerfprobe)
> **The Detector**

Detects silent model collapse, quantization artifacts, and instruction failures with 17 research-backed probes (Math, Style, Timing, Code, Fact, JSON, Consistency, Fingerprint, and more).

- 🔬 [17 scientifically-grounded instruments](https://github.com/nerfstatus/nerfprobe)
- 📦 `pip install nerfprobe`
- 📊 [nerfstatus.com](https://nerfstatus.com) — Real-time dashboard

### [SpeakOps](https://github.com/speakops/desktop)
> **The Amplifier**

"DevOps for your Voice." Analyzes your speech in real-time during interviews, sales calls, or presentations and sends HUD-style teleprompter hints to your phone. Hybrid AI: local STT (privacy) + cloud intelligence (quality).

- 🎤 [Real-time Speech Telemetry](https://github.com/speakops/desktop)
- 🔊 [Cloud service](https://github.com/speakops/cloud) — Whisper + Llama 3.1
- 📱 [Phone PWA](https://github.com/speakops/phone) — Progressive web app

## ✍️ Writing

**[SeekingSota](https://seekingsota.com)** — Weekly essays on AI × Human identity crisis

I don't write code anymore. I just yell at agents.
*And sometimes they listen.*

SeekingSota explores what happens when engineers stop programming and start conducting AI agents. Real agent workflows, technical deep dives (made accessible), philosophy of production, and honest stories about the identity crisis that comes with this transformation.
